SLTC Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SLTCproject/SLTC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SLTCproject/SLTC)

SLTC is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Anonymized transactions using zerocoin technology
- 100% Proof of Stake 3.0 Consensus protocol, allowing very low transaction fees and energy expenditure, and staking rewards to all participants in the network
- Masternode technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each Masternode is secured
  with collateral of 10K SLTC
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.

17.6M SLTC was produced for swapping. 500k were mined 1-200 blocks to bring that amount to 18.1M SLTC, the amount needed for the swap.

Since then, the SLTC repository has been rebaselined to show the fork relationship properly.
